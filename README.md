# OpenGL-Template

An OpenGL-Template project that comes with ``Abstracted OpenGL Classes`` and the neccessary dependencies already set. 

# Dependencies 
- GLFW
- GLEW (OpenGL Wrangler Library)

# Using it
There is a small demo program with 2 (very) basic shaders on how to use the abstract classes in the ``.cpp`` file. It encapsulates the main points on how to use the abstracted classes etc.. 
It is a very simple demo that just renders a 2D quad on the screen.
